# Project Overview

Project Name: Second Chance Cinema (Mock Edition)

Description: A web application that simulates a community-driven platform for reviving obscure or panned movies. Users can suggest forgotten films, vote on their favorites, and simulate funding a "director's cut" re-edit. All backend processes (user accounts, voting, funding, etc.) are mocked on the frontend.

Features:

*   Movie Suggestions: Users can submit movie titles and descriptions.
*   Poster Images: Placeholder images will appear for each suggestion.
*   Community Voting: Users can "vote" on movies they want to see revived.
*   Simulated Funding: A mock funding progress bar shows community support.
*   Commenting: Users can add comments on movie suggestions to build a community.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
